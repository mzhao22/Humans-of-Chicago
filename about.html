        <p> Hi, my name is Qi Zhang. I'm a currently a  graduate student majored in
        Information Architecture. And I hope to be a web designer after I graduate.</p>
        <p> I studied Advertising during my undergraduate period. Although I was not
        an engineer or science background student, my interdisciplinary background
        still helps me a lot.
        For instance, my undergraduate major experience helped me to develop a
        sense of choosing attractive things, which pushed me to keep high
        standards for my own web design.</p>
        <p> I have two important turning points for my career goal. The first one
        happened in my third year in university. My friend asked me whether I was
        interested to join a mobile app development team, and I could do UE and
        Product Management work. I feel lucky right now since I choose to accept
        the invitation at that moment which helped me to get in touch with those
        web/software things. So with the experience in that team, I became a real
        product manager after I graduated and my first work lasted one year.</p>
